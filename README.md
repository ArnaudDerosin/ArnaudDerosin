<!-- Introduction -->
I’m passionate about translating project visions and objectives into reality, always willing to use my skills to solve problems in the engineering world. Detailled oriented, I attach great importance to each pixel. User interface as well as home design, calligraphy, art and nature are part of my inspirations.

I am always open to collaborating on projects and innovative/disruptive ideas. Feel free to connect with me.<br />
